---

## Goals

Define what success looks like for this sprint.

- Goal 1 (clear, verifiable)
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

---

## In Scope

Explicitly list what this sprint will cover.

- Feature, behavior, or capability
- Feature, behavior, or capability

---

## Out of Scope

Explicitly list what this sprint will *not* attempt to do.

- Deferred feature
- Future enhancement
- Known non-goal

> This section exists to prevent scope creep and over-eager AI assistance.

---

## System Context & Assumptions

Describe the system-level truths and constraints that apply during this sprint.

- Relevant architectural decisions
- Security or privacy assumptions
- Environment constraints
- Dependencies on previous sprints
